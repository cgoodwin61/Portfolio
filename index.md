## My Portfolio

Hi all, and thanks for making your way to my portfolio! My name is Chris Goodwin, currently wrapping up my coursework in the Data Science Masters Program at Bellevue Univeristy. Over the last couple of years, I have really harnessed my craft as a data scientist: data scraping and manipulating, analyzing, modeling, coding, data visualization are just some of the topics that we have really focused on. I hope you will see in this portfolio that I am ready to start my professional data science career!
