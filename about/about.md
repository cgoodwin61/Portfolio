My name is Chris Goodwin, and I am an aspiring data scientist! I have always had a passion for two things: numbers and sports. I realized early on that I did not have the skills to become a professional athlete, so I turned to the back of the trading cards and learned all of the stats that I could. It would be my ultimate dream to work in the sports data arena.

I currently live in Buffalo, NY with my fiancee Courtney and our dog Riley! If we're not out at the dog park, you can pretty much always count on us to be bundled up on the couch watching some Netflix.
