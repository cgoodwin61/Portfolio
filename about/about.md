## About Me

My name is Chris Goodwin, and I am an aspiring data scientist! I am wrapping up my Masters in Data Science from Bellevue University. I previously graduated from the University of Buffalo with a Bachelors degree in Mathematics and a minor in Statistics.

I have always had a passion for numbers. I realized early on that I did not have the skills to become a professional athlete, so I turned to the back of the trading cards and learned all of the stats that I could! It would be my ultimate dream to work in sports data.

I currently live in Buffalo, NY with my fiancee Courtney and our dog Riley! If we're not out at the dog park, you can pretty much always count on us to be bundled up on the couch watching some Netflix. Thanks again for taking the time to look at my portfolio, and if you have any questions head over to the contact page and I'll be sure to get back to you!
