My name is Chris Goodwin, currently a student at Bellevue University. I am obtaining my Masters in Data Science. I previously attended the University at Buffalo, majoring in Mathematics with a minor in statistics. I have always been obsessed with numbers. Math has been my favorite subject since I can remember, and I love that I can apply this passion with other interests, such as sports or movies.

I currently live in Buffalo, NY with my fiancee Courtney and our dog Riley! The sterotypes are unforunately true, we love our chicken wings! When we're not out hiking a new dog trail, we mostly just sit inside and watch Netflix or our beloved Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres. Finding a career in sports data is my ultimate goal!
