## LSTM Text Generator

Text Generation is a type of Language Modelling problem. Language Modelling is the core problem for a number of of natural language processing tasks such as speech to text, conversational system, and text summarization. A trained language model learns the likelihood of occurrence of a word based on the previous sequence of words used in the text. Language models can be operated at character level, n-gram level, sentence level or even paragraph level. 

In this project, we uploaded a .txt version of the Bible. We then created a model that would attempt to create a passage of its own. Please enjoy our results!
