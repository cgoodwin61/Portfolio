## QB Analysis

For fans of American football, it is well known that the quarterback (QB for short) is the most important player on your team. A football QB, like no other role at any team game, normally reflects his execution on the final score. It's atypical that a bad day for a QB could translate in a good day for the rest of the team. Like no other position, passer's decisions guide the offensive side of the game, the one that leads to score points. Excluding a few anomalies, the QB is the key for wins and championships

Our research will look at game logs for NFL quarterbacks and determine if we can fit a model that can accurately predict whether or not his team won. This analysis will allow us to gain access into how the game of football is currently being played, and may even help coaches gain focus in particular aspects of the passing game.
