## Dodger Game Promotions 

If you have been to a baseball game, you know that teams love to run promotions. Bobblehead night, fireworks, free popcorn- teams will go to lengths to get fans in their stands.

The goal of this project was to determine if there were specific nights or times of the year they should run these promotions in order to maximize attendance. This project uses a combination of techniques in R and Python.
