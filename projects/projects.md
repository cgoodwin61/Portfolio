## Projects

As I stated on the home screen, I chose these projects to show I am not one-dimensional. I can perform a many number of tasks with the data science realm. Below are a list of projects, with a brief description and a link to the Github repository:


### Project #1: [**Airline Safety Analysis**](https://github.com/cgoodwin61/Portfolio/tree/main/Airline_Safety_Analysis)

</p>
- In this project, we really focused in on utilizing data visualization tools to tell a story. The ultimate goal was to prove airline travel was safe, and I believe we did just that. 

### Project #2: [**College Basketball Analysis**](https://github.com/cgoodwin61/Portfolio/tree/main/College_Basketball_Analysis)
<p align="center">

</p>
- In this project, we attempted to create a model that could predict how many wins a given college basketball team would have in a season, but on certain characteristics (offensive efficiency, rebounding, conference, etc). 

### Project #3: [**ConvNet Classifiers**](https://github.com/cgoodwin61/Portfolio/tree/main/ConvNet_Classifiers)

### Project #4: [**Hotel Recommendation Model**](https://github.com/cgoodwin61/Portfolio/tree/main/Hotel_Recommendation_Model)

### Project #5: [**LSTM Text Generator**](https://github.com/cgoodwin61/Portfolio/tree/main/LSTM_Text_Generator)
<p align="center">

</p>
- In this project, we attempted to create an LSTM Text Generator that would read text from the Bible and attempt to create a passage of its own. 

### Project #6: [**Movie Rating Analysis**](https://github.com/cgoodwin61/Portfolio/tree/main/Movie_Rating_Analysis)
<p align="center">

</p>
- This project highlights data scraping tools. We evaluated moving rating data from three sources: a csv download, an HTML scrape, and an API. 

### Project #7: [**NFL Quarterback Analysis**](https://github.com/cgoodwin61/Portfolio/tree/main/QB_Analysis)
<p align="center">

</p>
- In this project, I attempted to use QB Game Logs to predict whether or not his team won the game. This showcased my skills using classification algorithms in Python.

### Project #8: [**SQLite Examples**](https://github.com/cgoodwin61/Portfolio/tree/main/SQLite_Example)
- This project highlights my skills in running queries, both in SQL in general and specifically within the SQLite package. 

### Project #9: [**Spotify Popularity Analysis**](https://github.com/cgoodwin61/Portfolio/tree/main/Spotify_Analysis)
<p align="center">

</p>
- In this project, I attempted to predict the popularity of a song on Spotify based on some characteristics of the song (tempo, volume, date, etc). This showcased my skills using regression algorithms in Python.

### Project #10: [**Chest X-Ray Classification**](https://github.com/cgoodwin61/Portfolio/tree/main/Chest_XRays)
<p align="center">
<img src="pneumonia5.png" alt="Chest X-Rays" width="400">
</p>
- In this project, I built an image classification model that would predict whether a given set of lungs was healthy or had pneumonia. While still somewhat a novice at image classification, this project shows an understanding of how to use and interpret a model in keras.
