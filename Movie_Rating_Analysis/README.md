## Movie Rating Analysis

When I decide to watch a movie, I can’t help myself from looking at a movie review. There are multiple options available to us right at our fingertips, with IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes leading the way. With a simple search, we can see what both critics and fellow audience members think about any movie. The questions I have are twofold: 1) Do IMDb ratings and Rotten Tomatoes ratings correlate with one another and 2) If yes, does this correlation apply to every genre of movie?

How will we answer these questions? We will use a variety of different methods:

1) A database of titles currently available on Netflix in the Unites States

2) Pulling these titles’ Rotten Tomatoes scores using Beautiful Soup

3) Pulling these titles’ IMDb ratings from the OMDB API

Once we have all of our data, we will perform some regression analysis techniques to figure out exactly what is going on. Please note that these steps are broken down into different Milestones in the final .ipynb, Movie_Ratings.ipynb.
