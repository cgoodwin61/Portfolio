## Airline Safety Analysis

This here was more of a "fantasy" project. We were to pretend that recent events had made it so that people become weary of airline travel. We had to use data wrangling and visualization techniques to help persuade people that airline travel was actually incredibly safe. In this repository you will find a number of artifacts that I compiled to help prove the safety of airline travel. Charts were made using Tableau, Python, and R.
